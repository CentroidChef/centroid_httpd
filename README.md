# centroid_httpd

This cookbook is used in the Centroid Chef Lab to setup Apache on a Linux machine.
It is meant to be used for demo purposes.

It will install Apache (httpd), update SELinux to "permissive", setup firewall
rules and setup a default web page (index.html).

It was tested with OEL Linux 7 only.
